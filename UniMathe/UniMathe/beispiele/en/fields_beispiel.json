            "text": "A field is an algebraic structure consisting of a set K and two operations: addition (+) and multiplication (·).",
            "formula": "K = (K, +, \\cdot)",
            "explanation": "A field is like an extended set of numbers where we ensure that we can both add and multiply without leaving the structure. The key properties are that we can add, multiply, and also find inverses (except for multiplication by zero). Think of it like the rational or real numbers: no matter which two numbers we take, their sum or product stays within the set."

            "text": "Addition in a field satisfies four basic properties: associativity, commutativity, existence of an identity element, and existence of an inverse element.",
            "formula": "a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c \\\\ a + b = b + a \\\\ a + 0 = a \\\\ a + (-a) = 0",
            "explanation": "These properties ensure that addition in a field always leads to a unique result. For example, associativity means that the grouping in addition doesn’t matter. Whether we compute 1 + (2 + 3) or (1 + 2) + 3, we always get 6. Commutativity tells us that the order doesn’t matter: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. The identity element is zero, because any number plus zero is the number itself. Finally, the inverse element ensures we can always cancel a number out: 5 + (-5) gives zero."

            "id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003",

            "explanation": "For multiplication, we also want to ensure the structure remains stable. The identity element here is one, since any number times one gives the number itself. Unlike addition, we exclude zero in multiplication because zero has no inverse. A simple example: when multiplying the number 2, the order doesn’t matter (2 × 3 is the same as 3 × 2), and associativity allows us to group as we like: 2 × (3 × 4) is the same as (2 × 3) × 4."

            "formula": "a \\cdot (b + c) = a \\cdot b + a \\cdot c",
            "explanation": "This law states that multiplication distributes over addition. Think of the rule from school: if you compute 3 times (2 + 4), it’s the same as 3 × 2 plus 3 × 4. The result is 18 in both cases. This law is particularly useful for expanding brackets and makes many calculations simpler and clearer."
